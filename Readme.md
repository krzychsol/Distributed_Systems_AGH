# Distributed Systems AGH Course

This repository contains the solutions to the homework assignments for the course **Distributed Systems**, covering a range of topics such as SOCKETS, REST API, ACTOR MODEL, MIDDLEWARE, MESSAGE-ORIENTED MIDDLEWARE (MOM) and ZOOKEEPER.

- [**Lab1: Socket Programming**](./lab1_SOCKETS/)

The Lab1 directory contains the implementation of a simple chat application using sockets.  

- [**Lab2: REST API**](./lab2_REST_API/)

The Lab2 directory contains the implementation of REST API in Python FastAPI.

- [**Lab3: Actor model**](./lab3_RAY/)

The Lab3 directory contains the solution to the actor model homework assignment using the Ray framework. Students were expected to explore the actor model paradigm and apply it to a distributed system. The solution demonstrates the implementation using the Ray framework and Python language. 

- [**Lab4-5: Middleware**](./lab4-5_MIDDLEWARE/)

The Lab4-5 directory contains the solution to the middleware homework assignment using middleware technologies such as Apache Thrift, ICE and gRPC. My solution includes a smart home system written with Java and Python and using Apache Thrift. The second project deals with analyzing packets sent over the network when using optional arguments in middleware calls. I compared three middleware technologies: gRPC, ICE and Apache Thrift, and posted a report.

- [**Lab6: RabbitMQ**](./lab6-RABBITMQ/rabbitmq)

The Lab6 directory contains the solution to Message-Oriented Middleware (MOM) homework assignment using RabbitMQ. The project consisted of implementing an orthopedic department system. The application was written in Java.

- [**Lab7: Zookeeper**](./lab7-ZOOKEEPER/)

The Lab7 directory contains the solution to the Zookeeper homework assignment. In this assignment, students were tasked with creating a Java application using the distributed, replicated ZooKeeper environment and its watch mechanism.
