# Distributed Systems AGH Course

This repository contains the solutions to the homework assignments for the course **Distributed Systems**, covering a range of topics such as SOCKETS, REST API, ACTOR MODEL, MIDDLEWARE, MESSAGE-ORIENTED MIDDLEWARE (MOM) and ZOOKEEPER.

- [**Lab1: Socket Programming**](./lab1_SOCKETS/)

The Lab1 directory contains the implementation of a simple chat application using sockets.  

- [**Lab2: REST API**](./lab2_REST_API/)

The Lab2 directory contains the implementation of REST API in Python FastAPI.

- [**Lab3: Actor model**](./lab3_RAY/)

The Lab3 directory contains the solution to the actor model homework assignment using the Ray framework. Students were expected to explore the actor model paradigm and apply it to a distributed system. The solution demonstrates the implementation using the Ray framework and Python language.
